- Example monitoring setup:  
  `sentry-cli monitor --project series65`

---

## 6. Security Minimums

- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed.
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.
- HTTPS enforced for all network requests.
- Input validation on client and server.
- Regular dependency vulnerability scans.
- Example scan command:  
  `npm audit --production`

---

## 7. Test Coverage Targets

- Unit tests: ≥ 80% coverage.
- Integration tests: Cover all core workflows.
- End-to-end tests: Cover critical user journeys.
- Automated tests passing on CI: 100%.
- Example coverage report command:  
  `npm run test -- --coverage`
