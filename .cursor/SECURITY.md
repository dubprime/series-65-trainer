# Security Guide for Series 65 Training App/Game

## 1. Purpose
Security is critical to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure the integrity and availability of the Series 65 Training App/Game. This guide outlines best practices and policies to safeguard the application against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth (JWT):** User authentication is handled via Supabase Auth using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure, stateless sessions.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies:** RLS policies are enforced on all database tables to restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Role Separation:** Different user roles (e.g., admin, user) are defined with clear access boundaries to minimize privilege escalation risks.

## 3. Secrets Management
- Environment variables, including API keys and service credentials, are managed securely via Vercel and Supabase environment variable settings.
- Service role keys and other sensitive secrets are never exposed to the client side or included in frontend code.
- Access to secrets is restricted to only necessary services and personnel.

## 4. Database Security
- **Enforce RLS:** All database tables enforce Row-Level Security to control data visibility and modification rights.
- **Policy Review:** RLS policies are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current access requirements.
- **Least Privilege:** Database roles and permissions follow the principle of least privilege to limit access scope.
- **Migrations:** Database schema migrations are reviewed for security implications before deployment.

## 5. Data Protection
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is handled with strict confidentiality and limited access.
- Data is encrypted at rest using Supabase's built-in encryption and in transit via TLS.
- No real client data is used in training scenarios or test environments to avoid accidental exposure.

## 6. Secure Coding Standards
- Input validation is performed using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity and prevent injection attacks.
- Raw SQL interpolation is avoided; all database queries use parameterized statements or Supabase client methods.
- Errors are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive information to end users.

## 7. Vulnerability Management
- Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
- Security patches and updates are applied promptly to all components.
- Periodic security audits are conducted to identify and mitigate potential risks.

## 8. Incident Response
- Any suspected security breaches or vulnerabilities should be reported immediately to the development and security team.
- Incident response procedures include containment, investigation, remediation, and communication.
- Logs and audit trails are maintained to support forensic analysis.

## 9. Open Risks
- Potential risks include Supabase service downtime impacting availability.
- Misconfigured RLS policies could lead to unauthorized data access.
- Continuous monitoring and review are essential to mitigate these risks effectively.
