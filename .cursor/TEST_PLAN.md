# Series 65 Training App/Game - Test Plan

## 1. Purpose & Scope
Testing is critical to ensure the Series 65 Training App/Game delivers a reliable, accurate, and engaging learning experience. This plan outlines the approach to verify functionality, performance, security, and usability across all features including quizzes, flashcards, progress tracking, and administrative operations.

## 2. Test Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components and utility functions for correctness.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify interactions between components, API endpoints, and database operations.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user workflows such as taking quizzes, reviewing flashcards, and tracking progress.
- **Performance Testing:** Measure app responsiveness and load times, especially during quiz sessions.
- **Security Testing:** Ensure data protection, authentication, authorization, and prevent common vulnerabilities.

## 3. Test Environments
- **Local Development:** Developers run unit and integration tests locally using mock data.
- **Preview on Vercel:** Deploy preview builds for E2E tests and manual QA.
- **Production Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools and logging to detect issues post-release.

## 4. Test Cases
### Quiz Sessions
- Start, pause, and submit quizzes.
- Validate scoring and feedback accuracy.
- Handle edge cases such as timeouts and invalid inputs.

### Flashcards
- Create, edit, and delete flashcards.
- Test navigation and review modes.
- Ensure data persistence and sync.

### Progress Tracking
- Verify accurate recording of user progress.
- Test display of progress dashboards.
- Confirm data consistency across sessions.

### Admin Operations
- User management (create, update, delete accounts).
- Content management (upload, edit questions and flashcards).
- Access control and permission enforcement.

## 5. Automation & Tools
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Vitest/Jest frameworks.
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright for simulating user interactions.
- **Supabase Testing:** Mock and integration tests for database and auth.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated test runs on GitHub Actions for pull requests and deployments.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- All unit and integration tests pass without errors.
- E2E tests cover critical user flows and pass consistently.
- No critical or high-severity bugs remain open.
- Performance benchmarks meet defined thresholds.
- Security vulnerabilities are addressed or documented.

## 7. Regression Testing
- Run full test suite on every merge to main branch.
- Perform targeted regression tests before major releases.
- Use automated tests to quickly identify regressions.

## 8. Open Risks & Mitigations
- **Flaky Tests:** Regularly review and stabilize tests; isolate flaky tests for fixing.
- **Supabase Downtime:** Implement retries and fallback mechanisms; monitor service status.
- **Data Consistency Issues:** Use transactional operations and thorough integration tests.
- **Security Risks:** Conduct periodic security audits and update dependencies.
